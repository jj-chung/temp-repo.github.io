I'm a current MSCS student and CS 103 Mathematical Foundations of Computing Course Assistant at Stanford University. I graduated with a B.S. in CS + Math from Caltech in June of 2022.  I'm passionate about programming, teaching, writing robust code, problem-solving, and constantly striving to learn new things! Currently, some areas I'm interested in are algorithms, NLP, Ed Tech, and cybersecurity.
